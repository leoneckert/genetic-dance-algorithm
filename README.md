# Genetic Dance Algorithm

(my first code project*)

Genetic algorithms are a form of machine learning. They allow machines to adapt to different circumstances over time by translating Darwin's theory about human evolution into code. In this project the very same algorithm is used to dictate human movement.

*not taken the time to revisit the code :)

- Project was presenrted at [Codame Art & Tech Festival](http://codame.com/artists/leon-eckert) in San Francisco (2015).

# Requirements
Runs on [Processing 2](https://github.com/processing/processing/releases/tag/processing-0227-2.2.1) and uses this [GifAnimation library](http://extrapixel.github.io/gif-animation/) (which as of now does not work on Processing 3)
